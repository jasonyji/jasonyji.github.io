I am an incoming Ph.D. Student in Quantitative Marketing at The University of Hong Kong, to be supervised by [Prof. Shan Huang](https://www.shanhhuang.com/) and [Prof. Junhong Chu](https://www.chujunhong.com/). I am interested in exploring how digital technologies shape human behaviours.

I received my Bachelor's degrees with First-Class Honours in Computer Science and Business Administration from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Chi-Wing Fu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cwfu/) and [Prof. Yi-Shan Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/yi-shanlee).
