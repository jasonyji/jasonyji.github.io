## About Me
---
Hi everyone, and welcome to my personal website! I’m Yi Ji (計懿), a first-year Ph.D. student in Quantitative Marketing at <a href="https://www.hku.hk/" target="_blank">The University of Hong Kong</a>, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.shanhhuang.com/" target="_blank">Professor Shan Huang</a>. 

My research focuses on AI in Marketing, Human-AI Interaction, and Computational Social Science, exploring how artificial intelligence reshapes consumer behavior and business strategies. 

Before joining HKU, I earned dual bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Business Administration from <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html" target="_blank">The Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>, where I completed my final year project under supervision of <a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cwfu/" target="_blank">Professor Chi-Wing Fu</a>, and worked closely with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yi-shanlee" target="_blank">Professor Yi-Shan Lee</a>. I am also proud to be an alumnus of <a href="https://www.na.cuhk.edu.hk/" target="_blank">New Asia College</a>.

You can find my CV <a href="../files/CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
